### Technical description:
- Extra damage is added directly. The precise formula for determining the amount of damage added is the following:<br>

![berserk](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%28maxhealth-remhealth%29%20*%20%5Cfrac%7Blevel%5E2%7D%7B2%20*%20level%5E2%20&plus;%204%7D)

- This equates to about 16.7% of lost health at level 1, 33.3% of lost health at level 2, and 40.9% of lost health at level 3.<br>
The effect scales infinitely, and damage added approaches but never reaches 50% of lost health.
