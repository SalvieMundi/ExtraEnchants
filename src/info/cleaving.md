### Technical description:
- The amount of armor ignored scales with level, with diminishing returns. The precise formula for determining the percentage ignored is the following:

![cleaving](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?1.8%20*%20%5Cfrac%7Blevel%7D%7B2%20*%20level%20&plus;%204%7D)

- This equates to 30% armor ignored at level 1, 45% armor ignored at level 2, 54% armor ignored at level 3, and 60% armor ignored at level 4.<br>
As level increases, the armor ignored will approach but never exceed 90%.
