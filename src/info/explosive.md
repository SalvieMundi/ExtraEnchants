### Technical description:
- The resultant explosion has a power of lvl / 2 + 0.5, if the arrow hits the ground. The explosion power will match the level on direct hits. Arrows deal damage normally during dragon perching. None of the explosions deal block damage. (This will eventually be configurable)
